# ðŸ§° use-r3f-assets

A set of hooks for quick prototyping in [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber).

#### How it works

The assets are hosted on github and served using [githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/). When you are ready to go live, remember to donwload the assets and host them yourself!

#### `useNormalTexture`

Loads normal textures from this repository: https://github.com/emmelleppi/normal-maps


```jsx
const [normalMap, url] = useNormalTexture(
  1, // first argument is the index of the normal texture
  // second argument is texture attributes
  { 
    offset: [0, 0], 
    repeat: [normRepeat, normRepeat], 
    anisotropy: 8
  }
)

return (
...
<meshStandardMaterial normalMap={normalMap />
...
)

 ```
 
 ðŸ‘‰ Use the `url` to download the texture when you are ready for production!
