# ðŸ§° use-r3f-assets

A set of hooks for quick prototyping in [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber).

```bash
yarn add drei use-r3f-assets
```

## How it works

The assets are hosted on github and served using [githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/). When you are ready to go live, remember to donwload the assets and host them yourself!

#### `useNormalTexture`

Loads normal textures from this repository: https://github.com/emmelleppi/normal-maps


```jsx
const [normalMap, url] = useNormalTexture(
  1, // index of the normal texture
  // second argument is texture attributes
  { 
    offset: [0, 0], 
    repeat: [normRepeat, normRepeat], 
    anisotropy: 8
  }
)

return (
...
<meshStandardMaterial normalMap={normalMap} />
...
)

 ```
 
 ðŸ‘‰ Use the `url` to download the texture when you are ready for production!
 
 
 #### `useMatcapTexture`
 
 ```jsx
const [matcap, url] = useMatcapTexture(
  0, // index of the matcap texture
  1024 // size of the texture ( 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 ) 
)

return (
...
<meshMatcapMaterial matcap={matcap} />
...
)
 ```
 
  ðŸ‘‰ Use the `url` to download the texture when you are ready for production!
